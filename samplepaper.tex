%The design and cryptanalysis are the both sides from which we look at symmetric-key primitives. If a symmetric-key primitive is broken by a kind of cryptanalysis, it's definitely insecure. If a designer claims a symmetric-key primitive to be secure, one should demonstrate that the primitive resists against all known attacks. 

%%Differential and linear cryptanalysis are two of the most important kinds of cryptanalysis for symmetric-key primitives. To conduct a successful differential (linear) cryptanalysis, a differential (linear) distinguisher with significant differential probability (linear correlation) is needed. 

%%For some lightweight symmetric-key primitives, their best trails contain iterative trails. In this work, We present an algorithm searching for iterative trails by modelling it into a graph problem. We find that the clustering effect of iterative trails may enhance differential and linear propagations. If iterative trails found, we propose a method to estimate the probability (correlation) of differentials (linear hulls). 

%%We apply our methods to 256-bit KNOT permutation, ASCON permutation, PRESENT, GIFT-64 and RECTANGLE. The found iterative trails form a directed graph and are visualized. If iterative trails are found, our method can efficiently find good differentials and linear hulls. Our results imply that for the primitives we experiment on with bit permutations as their linear layers, the best differentials and linear hulls are dominated by iterative trails. 

%%For KNOT, which is a round 2 candidate of the NIST lightweight cryptography standardization process, we find differential and linear distinguishers with certain restrictions and truncations on the input and output differences or masks, which adapt the distinguishers to certain differential or linear attacks on the AEAD and Hash schemes. 

%An upper bound of the weight of the best trail with arbitrary rounds is obtained in several seconds. When the number of rounds is large, it's illustrated that the upper bound coincide with the best weight or is very tight. An upper bound of the weight of the best differential or linear propagation is also obtained by considering the clustering effect. For 14-round 256-bit KNOT permutation, 13-round GIFT-64 and 15-round RECTANGLE, better differential distinguishers than the best differential trails are obtained. For 10-round 256-bit KNOT permutation and 13-round RECTANGLE, better linear distinguishers than the best linear trails are obtained. Additionally, by constraining the input and output differences and masks, results for KNOT-AEAD fitting certain differential and linear attack scenarios in Duplex mode of operations are obtained.
