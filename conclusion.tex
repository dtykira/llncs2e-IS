\section{Conclusion\label{sec:conclusion}}

In this work, we propose a new automatic tool searching for iterative distinguishers for SPN symmetric-key primitives. We visualize iterative characteristics as a directed graph hoping to provide insignts on cipher designing. Based on the iterative characteristics, we efficiently find exploitable differentials and linear hulls. 
%It's shown that the best differentials and linear approximations are dominated by iterative characteristics. 

We have conducted an initial study on ASCON's inner permutation and GIFT-128. A question raised for designers is that, how to in purpose design a cipher with bit permutation as its linear layer can have no low-weight iterative characteristics. 

Our method is not only suitable for SPN primitives, but also suitable for primitives of Feistel structure with SPN round functions. We leave it in future work.
