\section{Conclusion\label{sec:conclusion}}

In this work, we propose a new automatic tool searching for iterative characteristics for SPN symmetric-key primitives. We visualize iterative characteristics as a directed graph hoping to provide insignts on cipher designing. Based on the iterative characteristics, we can efficiently estimate the probabilities of differentials and correlations of linear approximations. It's shown that the best differentials and linear approximations are dominated by iterative characteristics. 

We have conducted an initial study on ASCON permutation. For its comparatively strong diffusion layer, we can't find any iterative characteristic. A question raised for designers is that, whether a cipher with bit permutation as its linear layer can have no iterative characteristics.
