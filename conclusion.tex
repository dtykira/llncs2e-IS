\section{Conclusion\label{sec:conclusion}}

In this work, we propose a new automatic tool to search for iterative trails for symmetric-key primitives based on S-boxes. We visualize the graph representation of iterative trails hoping to provide additional insignts. Based on the iterative trails, we efficiently estimate the probabilities of differentials and correlations of linear hulls. The results show that for ciphers we test with bit permutations, the good differentials and linear hulls are dominated by the iterative trails. 

We have conducted an initial study on ASCON permutation. For its comparatively strong diffusion layer, iterative trails are difficult to find. 

A question raised for designers is that, whether a cipher with bit permutation as its linear layer can have no iterative trails. 

Our methods are also expected to be valid for lightweight Feistel ciphers by regarding two Feistel rounds as one round. We leave them for future work.
